Grade: A+

You have used Dafny to bound the time complexity of a moderately
complicated algorithm implementation (A* heuristic for TSP). This is
squarely within the specification for the project, and you've done a
good job describing what you've done.

I would be a bit more clear in Section 3 about how you are not
actually solving TSP (you'd be rich) but an approximation algorithm
for it.

I think average-time estimates would be a lot more useful but they are
also a lot harder---beyond the scope of this course for sure.
